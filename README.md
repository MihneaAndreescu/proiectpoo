## How to Play
- **Control Your Ship**: Simply use your mouse to steer the spaceship. It's intuitive and responsive to your every movement.
- **Collect Spice**: Navigate through space to collect colorful mushrooms, known as the spice. These are crucial for your survival and scoring.
- **Avoid Planets**: The cosmos is cluttered with planets that accelerate towards you. Avoid them to save your lives.
- **Lives**: You start the game with five lives. Use them wisely to achieve a high score.

## Beware the Cosmic Spectacle!
- **Radioactive Aftermath**: Every spice collection process leaves behind radioactive waste. This cosmic junk morphs into wild, twinkling stars designed to distract you. Their flickering brilliance may obscure looming planets, so stay sharp!
- **Stellar Collisions**: When two of these stars collide, the universe shivers, and a kilonova explosion ensues. Watch this astronomical event unfold before your eyes!
- **Birth of a Pulsating Heart**: The kilonova’s demise births a pulsating heart that lasts for a fleeting five seconds. Dare to collect it? It grants you an additional life—much like a heart in a romantic entanglement—but at a cost: you lose half your spice stash, akin to a star-crossed divorce settlement.

## Special Features
- **Invincibility**: After colliding with a planet, you gain a short period of invincibility. Use this time to your advantage.
- **Antigravity Fun**: During invincibility, antigravity kicks in, creating a unique and trippy gameplay experience. It’s fun and disorienting in the best way possible!
